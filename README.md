# redback-pvoutput
Fetches data from [Redback Technologies](https://redbacktech.com/) for your inverter and pushes to [PVOutput](https://pvoutput.org/)

Mostly Generated by [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), I fixed some of the nuances it didn't understand

You'll need the following bash vars defined somewhere (probably in your `.bashrc` file)

```
# Redback API Credentials
export RB_CLIENT_ID=<your_redback_client_key>
export RB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_redback_client_secret>

# PVOutput API credentials
export PVOUTPUT_API_KEY=<your_pvoutput_api_key>
export PVOUTPUT_SYSTEM_ID=<your_pvoutput_system_id>
```

You can request the redback info from redback by raising a support request asking for api access.

You can generate your PVOutput API key yourself on your PVOutput settings page
Your system id is the system you create in PVOutput to identify your solar setup, the id is unique

## Consider this Beta
I'm still fixing a few things and getting used to the apis.  So expect some echoing of junk for the time being.
You should probably consider running this via crondtab, only needs to run once every 5 mins

## Did you really use Chat GPT?
Yes I did.  It didn't get it exactly write, I'd day it got about 70-80% of it right and then I just connected the remaining bits

## Do you take feature requests?
Yes I do.

## Does this work with home Assistant?
No not yet.  You can find a good HASS HACS integration here, but it doesn't send to PVOutput: https://github.com/juicejuice/homeassistant_redback
